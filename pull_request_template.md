### RTL Engineering Principles Checklist

- [ ] **Secure by Default**: No secrets in code. Input is validated and access is properly restricted.
- [ ] **Observable and Measurable**: Structured logs and traces are in place. Errors are traceable.
- [ ] **AI-Ready and Evolvable**: Clean architecture (vertical slices), testable logic, no tight coupling.
- [ ] **Simplicity over Cleverness**: Code is easy to read and maintain. No unnecessary abstractions.
- [ ] **Decoupled and Domain-Aligned**: Bounded context respected. No leaking of internal models.
